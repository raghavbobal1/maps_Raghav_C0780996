#### About the project -

-> You can add markers by tapping on a map for four different cities in Canada. <br>
-> After selecting 4 citites,each city gets connected with a red coloured straight coloured line which is filled with green colour. <br>
-> The address of each location is displayed in the title and the snippet of the marker too. <br>
-> The address contains the following: <br>
   <t> • Thoroughfare, sub-thoroughfare and postal code <br>
   <t> • City and province <br>
    <br>
-> When the user taps on any of the lines, the distance between the two cities is displayed
beside each line.<br>
-> When the user taps in the middle of the quadrilateral created by the lines, the total distance is displayed. <br> 
-> The user should be able to drag the markers too. <br>
